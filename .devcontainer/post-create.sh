# `index` lives under the `project` group and takes the project as a positional
# argument — there is no top-level `serena index` and no `--project-root` flag.
# It auto-creates `.serena/project.yml` when absent and is safe to re-run: a
# second pass just refreshes the LSP cache under `.serena/cache/`.
#
# When auto-creating, Serena enables the majority language and then asks, one
# `input()` per language, whether to enable each additional one it detected.
# There is no non-interactive flag (`interactive=True` is hardcoded), and
# `ask_yes_no` does not catch EOFError, so a closed stdin fails the build with
# an empty error message. Feeding it "n" declines each extra server, which is
# the default those prompts offer anyway. `printf` rather than `yes`: a finite
# write fits the pipe buffer and exits 0, whereas `yes` would die of SIGPIPE
# and `pipefail` would surface that 141 as the status of a successful index.

# pnpm honours `packageManager` on its own — with the field set it switches to

# authority, and `pnpm self-update` is what moves it. `npm pkg get` prints `{}`
# for a missing key and the quoted value otherwise.

# Serena is indexed by `serena project index` above; MemPalace had no

# writes the config (mempalace.yaml, entities.json): `--yes` auto-accepts the
# detected entities but still asks before mining, and a closed stdin declines.
# `--auto-mine` is what fills the palace, and it is safe to re-run — mine skips
# files whose mtime it has already recorded. `--no-llm` skips the probe for an
# Ollama server the container does not run.
